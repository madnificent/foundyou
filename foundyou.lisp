  "Sends a call to Google and returns the response, as parsed by JSOWN.
   You must supply either latitude AND longitude, or address AND/OR components.  Nil-values are
   considered as not supplying the value.
   - address :: should be a string describing the address.  used when geocoding.
   - components :: describes the filtering which should occur when geocoding locations.
                   should contain either a string, as specified by
                   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/?hl=en#ComponentFiltering

                   (snippet taken from the link above):
                   - route matches long or short name of a route.
                   - locality matches against both locality and sublocality types.
                   - administrative_area matches all the administrative_area levels.
                   - postal_code matches postal_code and postal_code_prefix.
                   - country matches a country name or a two letter ISO 3166-1 country code.
   - latitude :: should contain the latitude, either as a string, or as a number.  used when
                 reverse geocoding.
   - longitude :: should contained the longitude, either as a string, or as a number.  used when
                  reverse geocoding.

               prominently. This parameter will only influence, not fully restrict, results from the
               geocoder. (For more information see Viewport Biasing below.)
   - language :: The language in which to return results. See the list of supported domain
                 languages. Note that we often update supported languages so this list may not be
                 exhaustive. If language is not supplied, the geocoder will attempt to use the
                 native language of the domain from which the request is sent wherever possible.
   - region :: The region code, specified as a ccTLD (\"top-level domain\") two-character value.
               This parameter will only influence, not fully restrict, results from the geocoder."

  "Geocodes <address>, a string.
   Returns (values coords specificity formatted-address result-jsown other-jsown-results) if a
   result was found, or nil if no result was found.
   Documentation on each of the accepted keys can be found in the docstring for #'call-google-v3.
   - coords :: a list with the latitude as the first, and the longitude as the second element.
               both latitude and longitude are numbers.
   - specificity :: A number from 0 to 10 indicating how good the result was.  This is based on the
                    \"location_type\" keyword in the result.  10 means the address was found
                    exactly, 1 means the address is very vague.  0 means we don't quite know what
                    Google is trying to tell us.  We use numbers to make comparison easier.  The
                    numbers which we use for Google's terms are stored in the constants +rooftop+,
                    +range-interpolated+, +geometric-center+ and +approximate+.  If Google supplied
                    a location_type unknown to us, the specificity is 0 (or +specificity-unknown+).
   - formatted-address :: The found location, as formatted by Google.  Handy for cleaning up user-
                          supplied locations.
   - result-jsown :: This value contains the resulting jsown object from which we parse the
                     necessary information.  It contains some extras such as address_components
                     which didn't seem that important to us.  If you don't mind tying yourself to
                     the Google Maps API v3, you may use this to gain more information.
                     What is in here is described in the first element of \"results\" of
                     https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/?hl=en#JSON
   - other-jsown-results :: In most cases there will be a single result matching your geocode
                            request.  However, Google indicates that it may return more than one
                            result if the request was ambiguous.  The list of other results is
                            returned in this value.  Each of the elements in the list is formatted
                            in the same way as result-jsown.  The function #'decode-geocode-result
                            may help you in interpreting these objects.  It is NOT exported from
                            this package to reduce confusion."
